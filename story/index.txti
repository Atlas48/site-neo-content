h1. Stories

Decided to try my hand at making some stories! Currently, it's just some small faux-exerpts to practice, currently, but I hope to make something much larger in the future!

h2. Exerpts

- "First Steps":first_steps.html ["Plaintext":first_steps.txt] := A little warm up to see how horrendous I was when writing something without dialogue. Apparently not.
- "Sycamore Gap":sycamore_gap.html ["Plaintext":sycamore_gap.txt] := A man wakes up in the middle of the night to make a resolution about his life. More a short story.
