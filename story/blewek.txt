Blewek towered above his compatriot, almost double the size of the miniscule Ysengrin. A vast form, dusted in black scraggly hair which was most prominent
upon his broad-shouldered torso. Upon his forhead lay two goat-like horns that curved to the back, accompanied below by two prominent tusks, with a strong jaw and
bony face to hold them, and eyes above that glinted like small rubies.
His clothing, simple and inexpesive like that his compatriot's, consisted only of a set of ragged burlap trousers, slapped together with patches of leather haphazardly
applied, supposedly in areas he thought "needed toughing up". A single, glittering ornament, barely visible in the forest of hair, hung around a tree-trunk neck,
via a chain of gold.
