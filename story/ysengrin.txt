Ysengrin was small, about a third of the average man, and distinctly bestial. A vulpine cranium perched upon slightly hunched and fuzzy orange shoulders
leered at one slightly with sharp almond pupils set within the colour of leaf litter. The fox head was accompanied by a corresponding well-kept fluffy brush
that trailed behind him for about two thirds of one of his legs. He wore an open overcoat in green and mock-gold, and the same sort of burlap trousers
as his compatriot. At a distance, he could be mistaken for a regular fox erect on two hindpaws, but a closer inspection revealed a more hominid shape.
