# Intro

> The year is 2721, Mankind has established colonies on the Moon and Mars, and plan to expand to other planets, as well. Hyperspace
> technology has been developed with the use of a newly discovered force called "Thauma", which allows seemingly magical effects that
> defy the laws of physics with minimal effort. Biological engineering and nanotechnology have evolved to the point where people can
> rewrite their DNA and appearances on the fly, and humans have evolved and genewarped into separate species over the last few centuries.
> Megacorperations and nations jostle for control of a new force and planetary territory, while something dark since awakened stirs
> from an ancient sleep in a realm beyond the stars.

This campaign takes place in the custom *Elysium's Edge* setting for Starfinder 1<sup>st</sup> edition, as this setting was initially kludged
around the mechanics and setting of Dungeons and Dragons 5<sup>th</sup> edition, a lot of concepts and races are heavily inspired, or are
directly taken from setting typical of that system, as a result, only 4 of the 7 core races are actually playable, with nearly all
of the legacy core races being playable. This setting also adds or reskins certain races

# Initial Plot

> You will be starting on Moonbase 1, dubbed *Crisey* by the locals. Due to reasons outside of your control, you have somehow found
> yourself stranded on the moon, and wish to get off of it. The moon is a dangerous place, full of sin, debauchery and crime, ruled
> over by a belligerent, constantly-bickering & loosely-connected oligarchy that has a habit of vying for eachother's territory, who
> are known to them as the "Barons". True to the old tradition, you've all found eachother sitting at the same table
> in a local pub, and are starting to talk about how you've all fallen on hard times.
