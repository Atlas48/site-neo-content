# The Solar System

The main focus of the setting, sort of along the lines of the Sword Coast in Forgotten Realms,
or Seattle in Shadowrun.

The Solar system in Elysium's Edge is a vast, tonally diverse subsetting,
with each planet providing a different feel.

## Earth

## Moon

> That a hein's cake, brat. We juwet, Dustball here is OB and he's ordered us put.

Up until about 50 years ago, the Moon was a straw libertarian's paradise.
Lavish resorts, caviar, corperation-owned infastructure, the Moon was seen as a shining symbol of Adam Smith's invisible hand...

Up until the revolution happened.

## Mars

> Amige, sori, te llamo p'atras, Boss is asking me about the Shtaubman in the LBM's office.

## Saturn

> Good work, team. That's enough for today. Can't believe we've come so far.
