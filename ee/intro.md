# The Solar System

The main focus of the setting, sort of along the lines of the Sword Coast in Forgotten Realms,
or Seattle in Shadowrun.

The Solar system in Elysium's Edge is a vast, tonally diverse subsetting,
with each planet providing a different feel.

## Earth

> Haiya, abe, we're homebound and we're still eating gummy. I can't believe it...

The Homeworld, the capital of capitals. Offworlders see the Earth as a shining, glizty place, full of life and riches beyond their wildest dreams.
In truth, it's the same blue waterball as 700 years ago, just with more skyscrapers.

## Moon

> That a hein's cake, brat. We juwet, Dustball here is OB and he's ordered us put.

About 50 years ago, the Moon was a straw libertarian's paradise.
Lavish resorts, caviar, corperation-owned infastructure, the Moon was seen as a shining symbol of Adam Smith's invisible hand,
complete with massive, overworked, underpaid underclass.

So, of couse the inevitable happened.

The Moon was consumed in a blaze of fire and glory, the corps were overthrown, and the common man could once again decide his fate.

*for about a total of 4 days...*

Unfortunately, the chaos further degenerated into an every-man-for-themselves murder-shoot-loot spree.
Of course, sombody had to step up to control it all, and for the most part that fell to organised crime in it's various forms.

## Mars

> Amige, sori, te yamo paatras, Boss is asking me about the Shtaubman in the LBM's office.

Mars is the Americas, as the Americas were to Europe. A shining beacon of hope and industry with dreams of their own identity.
Whenever you think of the sterotype of space as a boundless frontier full of new oppotunty, that's the general sort of vibe you get with Mars.

## Saturn

> Good work, team. That's enough for today. Can't believe we've come so far.

The most inhospitable colonised planet, Saturn's entire population consists mainly of miners and researchers,
with a notable exception being a single sports stadium.
